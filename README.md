# Traum Tools

This plugin for Blender comprises the bulk of our pipeline for Traum II.


Levels and other models are both done in Blender, then fed through this script 
to make them usable by the engine. It is currently under active development.
Mind the dust please.


Requires Blender 2.82 to run
